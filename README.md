# kotlin-csvparser
a simple yet quite powerful csv parser written in kotlin

Feel free to fork and contribute, or use in your own project. 

Test coverage is sufficiently good, so changes should be acceptable stable. 

The memory consumtion of fields is possibly too high, as it stores the name with each field. It should be easy to implement a direct to object mapper in the parser. I am currently not looking into this, but you may be interested. If so, let me know.
